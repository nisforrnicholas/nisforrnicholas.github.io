### [ What is the user flag? ]

Let's start with a full nmap scan on the target machine.

```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -vv -T4 -p- 10.10.117.76
```

**Results:**

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 61 OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```

There are 2 ports open: **22 (SSH)** and **80 (HTTP)**

Let's take a look at the HTTP website:

![screenshot1](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot1.png)

We are brought to a Coronavirus contact tracing page.

It seems that we can input an 'Establishment Code'. I tried to input some random data, but clicking the submit button does nothing. There is also a link to the admin panel. Let's visit it:

![screenshot2](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot2.png)

And we have a login page!

I tried logging in with various default credentials, but unfortunately none of them worked. Without a valid username, it is also difficult to try and brute-force any passwords.

From here, I did a lot of digging around the website before finding something interesting when intercepting the login response using Burpsuite:

![screenshot3](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot3.png)

We can actually see the SQL query that is sent to the server when logging in! With that, I tried submitting a basic SQL injection payload in the username field, to log in as the user 'admin':

```
admin'-- 
```

 *(Make sure to include a space after '--')*

![screenshot4](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot4.png)

And we're in! We are brought to an administrative dashboard.

My first thought was to find a place where I can upload a PHP reverse shell. Looking around the dashboard, I found that I could update the **system logo** by clicking on the gear icon at the top-right of the screen. 

![screenshot6](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot6.png)

After uploading the reverse shell file, we can trigger the reverse shell by logging out and visiting the main page again:

![screenshot5](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot5.png)

The web server will call the file that we uploaded, causing the reverse shell to be opened:

![screenshot7](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot7.png)

And we've now gained a foothold onto the machine!

Looking in the /home directory, we see that there are 2 users - **cyrus** and **maxine**:

![screenshot8](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot8.png)

Unfortunately, we do not have the permissions to access their home directories.

Next, I visited the /var/www/html directory to see if I could find any interesting files. Sure enough, there was a file called **DBConnection.php** which contained valid credentials to access the SQL database:

![screenshot9](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot9.png)

Let's log into the SQL database with our newfound credentials:

```
mysql -u cts -p
```

![screenshot10](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot10.png)

Exploring the database, I found a table called **users** in the **cts_db** database:

``` 
use cts_db;
select * from users;
```

![screenshot11](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot11.png)

We see a hashed password under the password column.

I was able to easily crack this password using `john`:

```
john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=Raw-MD5
```

![screenshot12](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot12.png)

Nice! We have a potential password for either cyrus or maxine:

> sweetpandemonium

Let's try to log into their accounts. Make sure to upgrade your shell to a fully-interactive TTY shell first:

![screenshot13](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot13.png)

It turns out the password belongs to cyrus :smile:

With that, we can access cyrus' home directory and obtain **user.txt**:

### [ What is the root flag? ]

Before moving on to escalating our privileges, let's first log into the machine via SSH so that we don't have to use the reverse shell anymore. When I tried to log in directly, I realised that the SSH server did not accept password-based login.

Fortunately for us, cyrus' home directory contains the **.ssh** directory with the **authorized_keys** file. Hence, all I had to do was to add my own public key into that file. With that, I could then ssh into the machine using my private key:

![screenshot15](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot15.png)

Cyrus' home directory contained an empty directory called **quarantine** and a file called **testvirus**:

![screenshot16](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot16.png)

There wasn't much I could do with those files at the moment, so I moved on first.

Checking cyrus' **sudo privileges**, we see that they can run a script called **scan.sh** as root:

![screenshot17](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot17.png)

Let's take a look at this script:

![screenshot18](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot18.png)

The script takes in a path as user input. Next, it uses `clamscan`, which is a command-line antivirus scanner, to scan all files within the specified directory. Any files with viruses detected are then copied into /home/cyrus/quarantine. Finally, the copied files will have their owner changed to cyrus.

My first thought was to have this script scan the **/root** directory directly. Then maybe the **root.txt** would be copied over to the quarantine directory. However, I realized that this would not work as the root.txt will not be recognized as a virus and hence, won't be copied over...

What if there was a way to define our own virus rules? Doing some research online, I stumbled across the following [website](https://docs.clamav.net/manual/Signatures/YaraRules.html). It seems that we can define **YARA rules** in ClamAV!

*(below shows an example YARA rule file from the website):*

![screenshot19](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot19.png)

I created my own rule file called `root.yar` and stored it in **/var/lib/clamav** (where ClamAV keeps its virus database):

```
rule obtainroot
{
	strings:
		$a = "THM"
	condition:
		$a
}
```

Since we know the root flag has the format 'THM{...}', I defined the rule such that any file with the string **'THM'** will be considered as a virus.

With everything set up, let's run scan.sh again on the **/root** directory:

![screenshot20](../assets/images/lockdown/screenshot20.png)

We can see that the **root.txt** file was successfully detected as a virus, and was copied over to /home/cyrus/quarantine.

Since the copied root.txt file has its owner changed to cyrus, we can read it and obtain the **root flag**:
